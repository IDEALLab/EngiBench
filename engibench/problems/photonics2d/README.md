# Photonics2D

**Lead**: Mark Fuge @markfuge

Photonics2D is an example photonics problem (a two wavelength Demultiplexer) that is essentially a EngiBench compatible wrapper for the open source [`cerviche` Finite Difference Frequency Domain (FDFD) solver](https://github.com/fancompute/ceviche). This problem essentially is just wrapping the Optical Inverse Design demo shown [in this GitHub Repo](https://github.com/fancompute/workshop-invdesign) to make it compatible with EngiBench and with little further modification therein.
