# Beams 2D (MBB Beam)

**Lead**: Arthur Drake @arthurdrake1

Beams 2D is a benchmark problem that aims to optimize a 2D MBB beam using the structural topology optimization (TO) approach. This is based on the 88-line code by Andreassen et al. (2011). We allow the user to specify the required set of boundary conditions and other parameters prior to optimization.
