# Airfoils

These problems aim at optimizing the shape of an airfoil. The airfoil is a cross-sectional shape of a wing, blade (such as a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail. Airfoils are designed to create a specific lift and drag force.  The goal is to optimize the airfoil shape to maximize lift and minimize drag.

TODO add images

We provide two versions for this problem:
- [airfoil2d]() TODO: In this problem, we optimize a 2D slice of airfoil.
- [airfoil3d]() TODO: This version is heavier, we optimize a 3D airfoil.
