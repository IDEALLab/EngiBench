# Heat Conduction

These problems represent typical topology optimization problems where the goal is to decide where to place material in the design domain.

We provide two versions for this problem:
- [Heat Conduction 2D](./heatconduction2d.md) In this problem, we optimize a 2D slice of an object.
- [Heat Conduction 3D](./heatconduction3d.md) This version is heavier, we optimize a 3D object.
