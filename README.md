<!-- start elevator-pitch -->
EngiBench offers a collection of engineering design problems, datasets, and benchmarks to facilitate the development and evaluation of optimization and machine learning algorithms for engineering design. Our goal is to provide a standard API to enable researchers to easily compare and evaluate their algorithms on a wide range of engineering design problems.
<!-- end elevator-pitch -->

## Installation
<!-- start install -->
‚ö†Ô∏è You might need Docker or Singularity to run some of the benchmarks.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you want to install with additional dependencies for a specific envs, e.g., airfoil2d, run:

```bash
pip install -e ".[airfoil2d]"
```
<!-- end install -->

## API

<!-- start api -->
```python
from engibench.problems.beams2d.v0 import Beams2D

# Create a problem
problem = Beams2D()

# Inspect problem
problem.design_space  # Box(0.0, 1.0, (50, 100), float64)
problem.objectives  # (("compliance", "MINIMIZE"),)
problem.conditions  # (("volfrac", 0.35), ("forcedist", 0.0),...)
problem.dataset # A HuggingFace Dataset object

# Train your inverse design model or surrogate model
conditions = problem.dataset["train"].select_columns(problem.conditions_keys)
designs = problem.dataset["train"].select_columns("optimal_design")
cond_designs_keys = problem.conditions_keys + ["optimal_design"]
cond_designs = problem.dataset["train"].select_columns(cond_designs_keys)
objs = problem.dataset["train"].select_columns(problem.objectives_keys)

# Train your models
inverse_model = train_inverse(inputs=conditions, outputs=designs)
surr_model = train_surrogate(inputs=cond_designs, outputs=objs)

# Use the model predictions, inverse design here
desired_conds = {"volfrac": 0.7, "forcedist": 0.3}
generated_design = id_model.predict(desired_conds)
# Only simulate to get objective values
objs = problem.simulate(design=generated_design, config=desired_conds)
# Or run a gradient-based optimizer to polish the generate design
opt_design, history = problem.optimize(starting_point=generated_design, config=desired_conds)
```

## Development

Clone the repo and install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:IDEALLab/EngiBench.git
cd EngiBench
pre-commit install
```

### Adding a new problem
<!-- start new_problem -->
In general, follow the `airfoil2d/` example.

#### Code
1. Create a new problem module in [engibench/problems/](engibench/problems/) following the following layout (e.g. [engibench/problems/airfoil2d/](engibench/problems/airfoil2d/)), where you later also can add other versions / variant of the problem:
   ```
   üì¶ engibench
   ‚îî‚îÄ üìÇ problems
      ‚îî‚îÄ üìÇ new_problem
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ __init__.py
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ v0.py
   ```

   `__init__.py`
   ```py
   """NewProblem problem module."""

    from engibench.problems.new_problem.v0 import NewProblem

    __all__ = ["NewProblem"]
   ```

   The `v0` module already proactively introduces versioning.

   Ideally, all non-breaking changes should not create a new versioned module.
   Also in many cases, code duplication can be avoided, by introducing a new parameter to the problem class.

2. Define your problem class that implements the `Problem` interface with its functions and attributes in `problems/new_problem/v0.py` (e.g. [airfoil2d/v0.py](engibench/problems/airfoil2d/v0.py)).

   `problems/new_problem/v0.py`
   ```py
   from engibench.core import Problem

   class NewProblem(Problem[...]) # <- insert type for DesignType here
       ... # define your problem here
   ```

   You can consult the documentation for info about the API; see below for how to build the website locally.
3. Run `pytest tests/test_problem_implementations.py` (requires `pip install ".[test]"`)
   to verify that the new `Problem` class defines all required metadata attributes.
4. Complete your docstring (Python documentation) thoroughly, LLMs + coding IDE will greatly help.

#### Documentation
1. Install necessary documentation tools: `pip install ".[doc]"`.
2. If it is a new problem family, add a new `.md` file in [docs/problems/](docs/problems/) following
   the existing structure and add your problem family in the `toctree` of [docs/problems/index.md](docs/problems/index.md).
3. Add a problem markdown file to the `toctree` in `docs/problems/new_problem.md`. In the md file, use EngiBench's own `problem` directive:
   ``````md
   # Your Problem

   ``` {problem} new_problem
   ```
   ``````

   Here, `new_problem` must match the name of the top level module where your problem class is defined.
   Here, `new_problem/__init__.py` is crucial as it makes the problem class discoverable to the `problem` directive by
   the reexport `from engibench.problems.new_problem.v0 import NewProblem`.
4. Add an image (result of `problem.render(design)`) in `docs/_static/img/problems`. The file's name should be `<new_problem>.png`, with your problem module as in the point above.
5. Run `sphinx-autobuild -b dirhtml --watch ../engibench --re-ignore "pickle$" . _build`
6. Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and check if everything is fine.
